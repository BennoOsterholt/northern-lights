# 2 methods:
#   1. copy the existing unit file from its default to /etc
#       /usr/lib/systemd/system -> /etc/systemd/system
#   2. add an override file (systemctl edit unit.service) -> create a unit.service.d/edits.conf file
#       do changes there

# method 2:
# how to reset settings

# Reset assertions and then re-add the condition we want
# settings are parsed as a list, one needs to first clear the list before re-adding all entries
